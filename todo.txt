add collisions between bullets and defense structures
make defense structures visually show damage in region they were hit

figure out bullet timing limitations - enemy shot freq?
add sound to shooting bullets

add collisions between friendly bullets and top of screen
add collisions between friendly bullets and bottom of screen

add special red command ship
figure out how to make red command ship appear once randomly mid-wave
add special red command ship sounds

implement lives
implement ship/lvl reset with any key? after death
show lives at bottom with ship images
draw green separation line at bottom of screen

add blowing up frame to enemies being destroyed
add blowing up frame to ship being destroyed

implement displaying/capping fps

implement scoring - 30pts type1, 20 type2, 10 type1, 50-300 command
create missing numbers in arcade style text
display a static score using arcade style text
add ability to track score with an integer
add ability to convert integer to arcade style text
add/test score display in arcade style text
add ability to display/store high scores

reset enemies and increase difficulty after all enemies die

handle enemies hitting bottom of screen(ship row), gameover, aliens invade

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-switch from polling for keys to checking for keys currently pressed

-add 1 enemy, create necessary structs and functions to display an enemy
-add other 2 enemy types
-create and display grid of enemies

-separate main into various c/h files

-figure out how to keep track of ticks/time
-animate enemies, make them switch between two looks

-figure out how to display fps
-figure out how to cap fps

-figure out ideal screen width/height and if i need to scale ship/enemies, i'm thinkin 1200x800 with scale x2

-resize screen to 1000x1000, scale ship/enemies x2

-add 4 defense structures, create necessary structs/functs to display these

-implement timer to get deltaTime between frames
-implement time independent movement for ship/enemies/bullets

-decide how to implement bullets/shooting
-add ability to shoot to main ship
-add ability to shoot to enemies

-add collisions between bullets and enemies
-add collisions between bullets and ship

-figure out bullet timing limitations - 1 ship shot at a time
-implement 1 ship bullet at a time, increase bullet speed

-add collisions between friendly and enemy bullets

-implement enemies speeding up after an enemy is shot down (exponential) (completed with switch/case, would like to switch to mathematical expression at some point)
-implement enemies animating faster after an enemy is shot down

-create damaged and destroyed (gone) defense images
