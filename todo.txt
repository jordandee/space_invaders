-separate main into various c/h files

-figure out how to keep track of ticks/time
-animate enemies, make them switch between two looks

-figure out how to display fps
-figure out how to cap fps

-figure out ideal screen width/height and if i need to scale ship/enemies, i'm thinkin 1200x800 with scale x2

-resize screen to 1000x1000, scale ship/enemies x2

-add 4 defense structures, create necessary structs/functs to display these

-figure out bullet timing limitations - 1 ship shot at a time
-implement 1 ship bullet at a time, increase bullet speed

-add collisions between friendly and enemy bullets

-implement enemies speeding up after an enemy is shot down (exponential) (completed with switch/case, would like to switch to mathematical expression at some point)
-implement enemies animating faster after an enemy is shot down

-create damaged and destroyed (gone) defense images
-add state array to defense structures to keep track of damage to its parts
-render defenses by 11x2 rects based on state array

-add special red command ship
-make red command ship appear once randomly mid-wave (spawn algo)
-figure out ideal screen height placement
-make command ship move across the screen
-implement collision detection with command ship and bullets
-implement scoring system for command ship deaths

-use GetDisplayBounds to check resolution and scale game accordingly (2 sizes: 1000x1000 or 500x500)

-implement lives
-show extra lives at bottom with ship images
-draw green separation line at bottom of screen

-fix dead enemies still shooting
-fix mysterious all grid enemies dropping down off screen at once bug
